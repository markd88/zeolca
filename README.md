### requirements:
1. working knowledge in React, Express, and MySQL.  
We use React as frontend, Express as backend, and MySQL as database, so knowledge in these two

2. cloud deployment experience is preferred but not required. for example AWS, GoDaddy, Microsoft
3. a fair understanding of how Life-Cycle-Analysis works  
4. problem-solving mindset and entrepreneurial experience.


## brief introduction:

As you can see, the repo contains three folders: lca-frontend, lca-backend, and utils.  
lca-fronted contains frontend files, which is a self-contained React app.  
lca-backend contains backend files, which is a self-contained Express app.  
utils contains Python scripts to manupulate excel data and convert it to mySQL.

This project is a prototype and under active construction.
